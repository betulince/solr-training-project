# Solr Training Project

This repository contains scripts written in Python to facilitate some operations for big data in Apache Solr search engine.

# What it's doing?

While doing my internship, I needed to shorten the time it takes to upload data from Ignite to Solr to keep the data up to date on a daily basis. I did some analysis for this.
I cross-checked how long it takes us to update collections, field types, fields, and data from scratch and just update the data.
But not only that, I had to do this for 10, 100, 200... or maybe more collections.
You can imagine how painful it must be to do this over and over for each collection.

That's why I wrote the script.

Enjoy it!
